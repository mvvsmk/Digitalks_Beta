A small attempt at making an emailing client / netork using C++ on Turbo C. This project has many limitaions like , it can only be used on a single system but is one of the small projects i am exteemly proud of.
It uses concpts of file handling and 3 .dat files to keep track of the user , his passwords, mails sent by him and also maintains an address book with all the people he had sent mail to.
